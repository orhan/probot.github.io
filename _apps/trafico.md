## How it works

Only watches the most recent commit :eyes::.

- Adds a `WIP` label if title starts from `WIP`, `[WIP]` or `WIP:` (can be disabled).
- Adds a `Waiting for Review` label when the PR does not have any reviews yet.
- Adds a `Changes requested` label when the PR has been reviewed with requested changes.
- Adds a `Approved` label when the PR has been reviewed and got approved (as many times as the branch's protection setting dictates).
- Adds a `Merged` label when the PR has been merged.

## Based on PRTriage Bot

This bot is based heavily on the [PR-Triage Bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/pr-triage/) by [Sam Yamashita](https://twitter.com/sota0805), so check that one if this one does not fulfill your needs.
